    <h2>EarFun Wave Pro: Long Battery Life & Rich Sound</h2>
    <p>The Wave Pro over‑ear headphones offer exceptional battery life. Review tests report over 52 hours of playback with ANC turned on, and EarFun claims up to 80 hours without ANC. A quick 10‑minute top‑up yields about 10 hours of listening. In addition to long runtime, the headphones feature decent active noise cancellation and come with both wired and wireless connectivity options as well as a protective carrying case.</p>
    <p>Comfortable ear pads and a lightweight design (about 268 grams) make the Wave Pro suitable for extended listening. They operate over Bluetooth 5.3 and support LDAC for high‑resolution wireless audio. Multipoint connection and a companion app with customisation options are also included, rounding out a comprehensive feature set for travellers and commuters.</p>
