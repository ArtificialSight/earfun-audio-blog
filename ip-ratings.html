  <h1>Understanding IP Ratings: Water &amp; Dust Resistance</h1>
  <p>Ingress Protection (IP) ratings tell you how well a device resists dust and water. The second digit denotes water resistance: IPX5 protects against water jets, IPX7 allows immersion for up to 30 minutes at shallow depths, and IPX8 covers more extreme submersion. The first digit rates dust protection: IP5X indicates protection against dust ingress, while IP6X means the device is completely dust-tight.</p>
  <p>When only the second digit is listed (e.g. IPX5), the device’s dust protection is not specified. Understanding these ratings helps you determine whether your earbuds or speaker can withstand rain, poolside splashes, or dusty environments.</p>
