    <h1>Understanding Bluetooth Audio Codecs</h1>
    <p>A comprehensive guide to wireless audio quality and codec compatibility</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>What are Bluetooth Audio Codecs?</h2>
    <p>Bluetooth audio codecs are compression algorithms that determine how audio data is transmitted wirelessly from your source device (phone, computer) to your Bluetooth headphones or earbuds. The codec used affects audio quality, latency, and battery life.</p>
    
    <p>Different devices support different codecs, and the final codec used depends on what both your source device and your EarFun audio device support. The devices will automatically negotiate and use the best mutually supported codec.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Common Bluetooth Audio Codecs</h2>
    
    <h3>SBC (Subband Coding)</h3>
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Universal - supported by all Bluetooth devices<br>
    <strong>Quality:</strong> Basic/Standard<br>
    <strong>Latency:</strong> ~200ms<br>
    <strong>Bitrate:</strong> Up to 328 kbps</p>
    
    <p>SBC is the baseline codec that all Bluetooth devices must support. While it provides decent quality, newer codecs offer significant improvements in sound quality and efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)</h3>
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS devices, some Android devices<br>
    <strong>Quality:</strong> Good<br>
    <strong>Latency:</strong> ~150ms<br>
    <strong>Bitrate:</strong> Up to 256 kbps</p>
    
    <p>AAC is widely used and provides better compression efficiency than SBC. It's the preferred codec for Apple devices and delivers noticeably better audio quality.</p>
    
    <h3>aptX</h3>
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Many Android devices, Windows PCs<br>
    <strong>Quality:</strong> Very Good<br>
    <strong>Latency:</strong> ~150ms<br>
    <strong>Bitrate:</strong> Up to 352 kbps</p>
    
    <p>Developed by Qualcomm, aptX provides near CD-quality audio with lower latency than SBC. Many premium Android devices and EarFun products support this codec.</p>
    
    <h3>aptX HD</h3>
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Select Android devices and PCs<br>
    <strong>Quality:</strong> Excellent<br>
    <strong>Latency:</strong> ~130ms<br>
    <strong>Bitrate:</strong> Up to 576 kbps</p>
    
    <p>An enhanced version of aptX that supports high-resolution audio up to 24-bit/48kHz, providing audiophile-grade wireless sound quality.</p>
    
    <h3>aptX Low Latency</h3>
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Gaming devices, some phones<br>
    <strong>Quality:</strong> Good<br>
    <strong>Latency:</strong> ~40ms<br>
    <strong>Bitrate:</strong> Up to 352 kbps</p>
    
    <p>Designed specifically for applications requiring low latency, such as gaming or video watching. Reduces audio delay to near-imperceptible levels.</p>
    
    <h3>LDAC</h3>
    <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Sony devices, some Android devices<br>
    <strong>Quality:</strong> Excellent<br>
    <strong>Latency:</strong> ~200ms<br>
    <strong>Bitrate:</strong> Up to 990 kbps</p>
    
    <p>Developed by Sony, LDAC can transmit up to 3 times more data than standard codecs, supporting high-resolution audio up to 24-bit/96kHz.</p>
