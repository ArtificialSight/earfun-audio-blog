  <p>The Tune Pro is an affordable pair of over-ear headphones that packs features often found in more expensive models. Dual dynamic drivers (40 mm and 10 mm) with polymer diaphragms deliver a balanced sound, and hybrid active noise cancellation helps block out background noise during commutes or flights. Connectivity uses Bluetooth 5.4 with multipoint support so you can switch between devices effortlessly.</p>
  <p>Battery life is impressive: EarFun cites up to 120 hours without ANC and about 80 hours when ANC is enabled. Physical buttons allow reliable control, and the companion app provides equaliser presets and a theatre mode to enhance your movie-watching experience.</p>
