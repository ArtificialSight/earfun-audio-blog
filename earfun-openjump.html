  <h1>EarFun OpenJump: Lightweight & Secure Fit</h1>
  <p>EarFun’s OpenJump headphones embrace an open-ear design that sits outside the ear canal, making them ideal for long sessions and sporting activities. Because they don’t insert into your ear, they feel almost weightless and don’t create pressure inside the ear. Flexible silicone ear hooks help keep the OpenJump secure during movement.</p>
  <p>The drivers consist of 14.2 mm wool composite diaphragms that use BassSurge technology and 3D surround sound to deliver a rich, natural soundstage. Touch surfaces and tasteful metallic accents finish off the design, ensuring the headphones not only sound good but also look sophisticated.</p>
