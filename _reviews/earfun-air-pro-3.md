# EarFun Air Pro 3 Review: Quiet Luxury on a Budget

The EarFun Air Pro 3 launched with an ambitious promise: deliver class-leading noise cancellation, crisp audio, and modern features without breaking the bank. After months of daily commuting, gym sessions, and Zoom calls, these earbuds still feel like the sweet spot between performance and price. Here's what you need to know before buying.

## Quick Take

- **Price**: $59.99 MSRP (often discounted to ~$49)
- **Highlights**: Hybrid ANC, Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio-ready hardware, Qualcomm aptX Adaptive, 45-hour battery, wireless charging case
- **Best For**: Commuters and hybrid workers who want real ANC on a budget without sacrificing app controls or call quality

## Design & Comfort

EarFun keeps the matte graphite finish consistent across the Air Pro line, but the Air Pro 3 refine the formula with a smaller case and lighter buds. At 5 grams per earbud, they disappear after a few minutes of listening. The included tips cover a generous size range, and the oval nozzle helps create a consistent seal that is crucial for ANC performance.

The touch-sensitive stems register taps reliably once you learn the timing. Double taps handle playback, while a long press cycles through ANC, Ambient, and Normal modes. The EarFun Audio app lets you remap gestures if you prefer volume control on the earbuds themselves.

## Sound Quality

The 11mm wool composite drivers deliver a tasteful V-shaped tuning that straddles fun and fidelity:

- **Bass** has ample punch for EDM or hip-hop but stays tight thanks to the aptX Adaptive codec. Even with ANC engaged, it avoids the overbearing boom common with budget buds.
- **Mids** are slightly forward, giving vocals welcome presence and clarity for podcasts or acoustic sets.
- **Treble** retains sparkle without veering into harshness. Cymbals and synths extend smoothly, and sibilance is rare even at higher volumes.

Using the EarFun Audio app, you can choose from six presets or craft your own EQ curve. The Custom preset finally sticks between sessions thanks to a firmware update earlier this year, a notable improvement over the launch experience.

## Noise Cancellation & Transparency

Hybrid ANC on the Air Pro 3 outpaces most earbuds under $100. Low-frequency rumbles from bus engines fade into the background, while office chatter gets reduced enough to stay focused. Transparency mode sounds natural, albeit slightly amplified, which helps when catching gate announcements at the airport.

While they don't reach the hush of Sony's flagship buds, the delta between the Air Pro 3 and premium models is narrower than the price gap suggests.

## Battery Life & Charging

EarFun quotes 9 hours of playback with ANC off (7 hours with ANC on), and our testing landed within 30 minutes of those claims. The case stores an additional 36 hours, and a quick 10-minute top-up yields roughly two hours of listening. USB-C fast charging remains handy, but wireless charging is the convenience play that sets the Air Pro 3 apart from other value earbuds.

## Connectivity & Controls

Bluetooth 5.3 ensures stable connections, even in congested environments like subway platforms. Multipoint pairing lets you keep your phone and laptop connected simultaneously, and switching is nearly instantaneous. Gamers will appreciate the low-latency mode in the app, which trims audio lag when watching videos or playing casual mobile games.

## Call Quality

A six-mic array with cVc 8.0 noise suppression keeps your voice intelligible. The buds excel in indoor calls and hold their own outdoorsâ€”wind filtering is competent up to moderate breezes. Colleagues reported a slight compression effect compared to using a dedicated USB mic, but no one complained about clarity.

## App Experience

The EarFun Audio app has matured into a reliable companion:

- **Sound modes**: Toggle ANC, Ambient, and Game mode
- **EQ**: Save custom curves or choose from genre presets
- **Controls**: Remap gestures and adjust volume steps
- **Firmware**: Seamless over-the-air updates to unlock new features

It's not as feature-rich as Sony's or Jabra's apps, but the essentials are here and thoughtfully executed.

## Pros & Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Effective hybrid ANC for the price | No auto-pause when removing an earbud |
| Balanced, customizable tuning with aptX Adaptive | Touch gestures take practice to avoid accidental skips |
| 45-hour total battery with wireless charging | Case finish can scuff without a sleeve |
| Reliable multipoint connectivity and low-latency mode | App required to unlock full feature set |

## EarFun Air Pro 3 vs. Air Pro 4

| Feature | Air Pro 3 | Air Pro 4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price | $59.99 | $79.99 |
| Codec Support | aptX Adaptive, AAC, SBC | LDAC, AAC, SBC |
| ANC | Hybrid | Adaptive Hybrid |
| Battery Life | 7h ANC on / 45h total | 8h ANC on / 32h total |
| Wireless Charging | Yes | Case upgrade required |
| Multipoint | Yes | Yes |

If you crave LDAC or improved wind reduction, the newer Air Pro 4 are worth the premium. Otherwise, the Air Pro 3 remain the better value buy, especially when sales dip them below $50.

## Buying Advice

Grab the Air Pro 3 if you need dependable ANC and rich sound without stretching your budget. They shine for commuters, students, and remote workers who want modern conveniences like wireless charging and multipoint pairing. Hold off only if you're heavily invested in hi-res audio streaming, where the Air Pro 4's LDAC support pays dividends.

## Final Verdict

The EarFun Air Pro 3 prove that you don't have to spend premium money to get a polished ANC experience. They're comfortable, customizable, and packed with features that genuinely impact daily use. For most listeners, these earbuds deliver 90% of what flagship models offer at a fraction of the cost.

**Rating: 4.4/5 stars**
