    <h2>Choosing the Right Earbuds: Cost, Fit, Battery & Noise Cancellation</h2>
    <p>Picking a pair of earbuds involves balancing price, comfort, battery life and features. Budget models under about $50 may sacrifice sound quality or durability, while mid‑range options between $100 and $200 often provide better audio performance, good battery life and a comfortable fit. Premium earbuds priced above $200 typically include high‑end drivers, extended battery life and advanced features like superior active noise cancellation (ANC).</p>
    <p>Fit is just as important as cost: earbuds and earphones come in various shapes, so look for a design that suits your ears and includes multiple ear‑tip sizes. Battery life can range from six to 12 hours on a single charge for most earbuds, with cases providing additional charges. Finally, consider whether you need ANC—this feature is useful for travellers and commuters but reduces battery life. Evaluate your typical listening environment to decide if ANC is worth the trade‑off.</p>
