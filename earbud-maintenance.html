  <h1>Maintaining Your Earbuds: Tips for Longevity &amp; Hygiene</h1>
  <p>Proper care ensures your earbuds last longer and remain hygienic. Regularly clean the ear tips and housings to remove dirt and earwax, which can degrade sound quality and cause infections. Avoid exposing your earbuds to excessive moisture unless they have an adequate IPX ratingâ€”always check the rating before taking them near water.</p>
  <p>Store and transport your earbuds in a protective case to prevent physical damage, and replace removable tips once they wear out or become misshapen. Finally, keep volume levels reasonable to avoid straining the drivers and protect your hearing.</p>
