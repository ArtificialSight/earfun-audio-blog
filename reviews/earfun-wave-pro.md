For commuting, studying, and flights, it punches above its price.

### Design & comfort
Over-ear, foldable design that's light enough for long sessions. Physical buttons are easy to learn; the trade-off is no touch gestures【198163581435146†L77-L95】.

### Sound & codecs
LDAC support and app EQ let you tailor the tuning. At this price, the overall sound quality is competitive; EQ can help fine-tune bass/treble to taste【198163581435146†L39-L46】.

### ANC & isolation
ANC is “decent” in the budget context — great for office and transit hum, though not as strong as premium flagships【198163581435146†L39-L46】.

### Battery & charging
Battery life is a headline feature and a core reason to choose the Wave Pro for travel and commuting【198163581435146†L39-L46】.

### Connectivity & app
Bluetooth 5.x with LDAC and a useful EarFun app (EQ, presets, controls)【198163581435146†L39-L46】.

### Alternatives
- **EarFun Tune Pro:** Even bigger battery claims (up to 120 h with ANC off, 80 h with ANC on) and dual‑driver design; fewer codecs (no LDAC)【343948175976384†L203-L229】.  
- **Anker Soundcore Life Q30/Q35:** Popular budget ANC with app; compare on comfort and codec needs.
