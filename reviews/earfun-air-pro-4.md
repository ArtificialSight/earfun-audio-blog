## In-Depth Analysis

### Sound Quality & Performance
The Air Pro 4's 10mm dynamic drivers deliver a balanced V-shaped sound signature that appeals to most listeners. Bass response is punchy without being overwhelming, mids are clear and present, and treble offers good detail and sparkle. The LDAC codec support elevates the listening experience significantly for compatible Android devices.

### Noise Cancellation Excellence
The adaptive ANC system performs exceptionally well for the price point, effectively reducing ambient noise from air conditioning, traffic, and office chatter. While it may not match the absolute best from Sony or Bose, it delivers 80% of the performance at 30% of the price.

### Comfort & Fit
Three sizes of silicone ear tips ensure a comfortable, secure fit for most ear shapes. The lightweight design (4.9g per earbud) makes them suitable for extended listening sessions without fatigue.
