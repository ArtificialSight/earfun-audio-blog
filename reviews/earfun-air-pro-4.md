**Verdict:** The **Air Pro 4** packs **adaptive ANC**, **LDAC/LE Audio**, solid comfort and a deep app for well under $100. It’s a fantastic budget flagship. Trade-offs: ANC can slightly change tonality and the mics are just okay in loud places.

### Pros
- Rich feature set (LDAC / LE Audio / multipoint / EQ)  
- Comfortable fit, multiple tips, stable connection  
- Excellent value vs bigger brands

### Cons
- ANC slightly affects sound character  
- Microphones struggle in very noisy scenes

### Price & where to buy
- **EarFun store** — <a href="#" class="cta-btn">Check price</a>  
- **Amazon** — <a href="#" class="cta-btn">Check price</a>

### Design & comfort
Light/stable fit with multiple ear tips and water resistance suitable for workouts/commutes.

### Sound & codecs
LDAC and app EQ deliver very good sound for the price. V-shaped tilt is easy to enjoy; EQ can flatten/brighten to taste.

### ANC & isolation
Adaptive ANC handles daily noise well (office/commute). Expect typical budget limits with airplane engine rumble.

### Battery & charging
Comfortably covers a workday with case top-ups; wireless charging support varies by bundle—check listing.

### Connectivity & app
Multipoint, in-app controls, presets, and custom EQ. Firmware updates improve stability/features over time.
