**Verdict:** The **Free Pro 3** are **compact ANC earbuds** that sound good for the money and fit small ears well. You get app EQ and a handy pocketable case. Downsides: transparency mode is weak, ANC is basic, and battery life is modest.

### Pros
- Very compact, comfortable fit  
- App EQ and pleasant tuning for the price  
- Great value when discounted

### Cons
- Basic ANC and weak transparency  
- Battery life is just okay

### Price & where to buy
- **EarFun store** — <a href="#" class="cta-btn">Check price</a>  
- **Amazon** — <a href="#" class="cta-btn">Check price</a>

### Design & comfort
Light, stable fit with multiple tips; easy everyday carry.

### Sound & codecs
Engaging tuning for pop and podcasts. EQ can nudge bass/treble if you prefer more punch or sparkle.

### ANC & isolation
Good for HVAC/office noise, less so for deep engine rumble.

### Battery & charging
Enough for commutes and gym sessions; lean on the case for top-ups.
