Dear EarFun Affiliate Manager,

I’m excited to reapply to the EarFun affiliate program. Since my previous application, I’ve built a dedicated audio gear website on my own domain with a professional design. It now hosts more than 10 detailed posts reviewing EarFun’s award‑winning earbuds, headphones, and speakers, plus buying guides and a deals hub. I also publish new content each week to keep the site fresh.

My audience consists of tech and audio enthusiasts from the US and beyond, and I promote my content via SEO, social media, and email. I plan to feature EarFun products prominently in comparison guides and coupon roundups, ensuring all promotions comply with FTC and Awin guidelines.

Please let me know if there’s any additional information you need. I look forward to partnering with EarFun and driving high‑quality traffic and sales.

Thank you for your consideration.
