    <h2>How Active Noise Cancellation Works</h2>
    <p>Active noise cancellation (ANC) uses microphones to monitor ambient sounds and then generates an opposite sound wave to cancel out the noise before it reaches your ears. This technique leverages destructive interference—when two waves of equal amplitude are 180 degrees out of phase, they cancel each other. By contrast, constructive interference occurs when waves are in phase and amplify each other.</p>
    <p>Because ANC is tailored to constant, low‑frequency noises like airplane engines or air‑conditioner hums, it is less effective at blocking sudden, high‑frequency sounds such as conversations or keyboard clicks. Understanding how ANC works can help you set realistic expectations for noise‑cancelling headphones and earbuds.</p>
